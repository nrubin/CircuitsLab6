\section*{Experiment 2}
In this experiment, we explore how series and parallel combinations of \nMOS transistors behave, 
and what affect these combinations have on the channel current, \Isat, as a function of gate voltage,
\Vg. In order to accomplish this comparison, we collected data for the channel current in both ohmic 
and saturation regions of operation for a single \nMOS transistor, two transistors in parallel, and
two transistors in series, using $V_{gb}$.
